*SQWARS: A Graphics-Lite Shmup*

__Sqwars__ is simple. There is you (green square), there are enemies (other colored squares) and there are bullets (small white squares).

There are __three types__ of enemies:  
__BadGuys__ are purple squares. They are standard enemies. They move at a moderate speed and shoot every now and then.  
__MadGuys__ are red squares. They're *mad*, so they shoot all the time! But that they have to concentrate on that, so they don't move fast.  
__FastGuys__ are yellow squares. They're fast (duh), but they don't shoot very often.

You have __three lives__. Be careful! You lose a life when you get hit by an __enemy's bullet__ or an enemy __gets past you__ and goes off the bottom of the screen.

Move with the __left__ and __right__ arrow keys. Shoot with the __space bar__. Press __P__ to pause the game.

__ProTip__: Your bullets will destroy enemy bullets if they hit each other. Be careful though; you can only have *seven* bullets on the screen at once!

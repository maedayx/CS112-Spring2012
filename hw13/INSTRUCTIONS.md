*SQWARS: A Graphics-Lite Shmup*

__Sqwars__ is simple. There is you (green square), there are enemies (other colored squares) and there are bullets (small white squares).

There are three types of enemies:
*BadGuys* are purple squares. They are standard enemies. They move at a moderate speed and shoot every now and then
*MadGuys* are red squares. They're __mad__, so they shoot all the time! But that they have to concentrate on that, so they don't move fast.
*FastGuys* are yellow squares. They're fast (duh), but they don't shoot very often.

You have __three lives__. Be careful! You lose a life when you get hit by an enemy's bullet or an enemy gets past you and goes off the bottom of the screen.

*ProTip*: Your bullets will destroy enemy bullets if they hit each other. Be careful though; you can only have seven bullets on the screen at once!

Name: Keenan Villani-Holland

Programming Background: Some Perl a long time ago, a LOT of PHP, fair amount of JavaScript, a class in C in high school, Python from Programming Web Apps, messed around with Ruby on Rails...probably more...

What I hope to get from the course: MOAR PROGRAMMING. I also want to become more proficient in Python, especially outside of App Engine, and get some more experience programming things that aren't displayed in a browser, since that's most of what I've done.
